    <title>Installing Geant3 :: VMC</title>
    <link>https://vmc-project.github.io/installation/geant3/index.html</link>
    <description>Geant3 with VMC requires the VMC core package and ROOT.&#xA;The vmc core package was separated from the ROOT source into a new stand-alone vmc package in the GitHub vmc-project organization. The motivation for this step was a gain in flexibility and faster workflow for new developments of multiple engine mode. The vmc package in ROOT is deprecated since ROOT version 6.18 (its compilation is optional) and it is going to be removed in the next ROOT version, 6.26. The VMC stand-alone is supported since Geant3 3.0.</description>
