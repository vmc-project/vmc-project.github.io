      <description>Geant4 VMC includes G4Root and MTRoot packages, which are independent from Geant4 VMC and can be build and used stand-alone. Use of G4Root, VGM, Geant4 G3toG4, UI and VIS packages in Geant4 VMC library is optional and can be switched on/off during CMake build.
Overview of available options and their default values:

      <description>The following instructions apply to the installation of versions &amp;lt; 3.0. For the required configurations of Root and Geant4 for these older versions see Special installations  page.
  Getting source   First get the Geant4 VMC source from the Download page.  Root configuration  Since the version 2.9 there are no special configuration options for Root needed.  The path to Root installation can be defined in two complementary ways:</description>

      <description>Root Configuration for geant4_vmc versions (2.x - 2.8)  The older geant4_vmc versions (2.x - 2.8) require Root to be configured with g4root package; for this you have to specify the following configure options:
 &amp;ndash;enable-g4root &amp;ndash;with-g4-incdir=$G4INSTALL/include &amp;ndash;with-g4-libdir=$G4INSTALL/lib/Linux-g++ &amp;ndash;with-clhep-incdir=$CLHEP_BASE_DIR/include \ 

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Geant4 configuration (version &amp;gt;= 9.5) &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; with manual installation (with GNUmake) &amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;  If you install Geant4 with the GNUmakefile build system and your own environment setting, you need to have set the following environment variables.</description>

      <description>Geant4 VMC requires ROOT and Geant4 installed, and optionally, it can be built with VGM. See below tips for configuration and installation of these packages.
The path to required and optional packages installations can be defined in these complementary ways:
a) Via path to the CMake configuration file
Geant4_DIR ... path to Geant4Config.cmake ROOT_DIR ... path to ROOTConfig.cmake VGM_DIR ... path to VGMConfig.cmake  b) With their configuration script available in your PATH (Geant4 and Root):</description>
