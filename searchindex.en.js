The choice of the navigation is done via the option specified with creating TG4RunConfiguration object (see VMC examples for more details):\ngeomVMCtoGeant4 - geometry defined via VMC, G4 native navigation geomVMCtoRoot - geometry defined via VMC, Root navigation geomRoot - geometry defined via Root, Root navigation geomRootToGeant4 - geometry defined via Root, G4 native navigation geomGeant4 - geometry defined via Geant4, G4 native navigation Below we shortly comment the implementation of these options:\ngeomVMCtoGeant4: The interfaces to functions for geometry definitions provided by VMC were strongly inspired by Geant3; the implementation of these functions in Geant4 VMC is therefore made with use of the G3toG4 tool provided by Geant4.\ngeomVMCtoRoot: The implementation of this option uses TGeoMCGeometry provided in the root/vmc package. The same class is used also by TGeant3TGeo and TFluka for supporting user geometry defined via VMC.\ngeomRoot: If geometry is defined via Root and G4Root navigation is selected, Geant4 VMC only converts the parameters defined in TGeoMedium objects to Geant4 objects.\ngeomRootToGeant4: The geometry defined via TGeo is converted in Geant4 geometry using the external Virtual Geometry Model (VGM), which has replaced the old one-way converters from Geant4 VMC (G4toXML, RootToG4), removed from Geant4 VMC with the version 1.7. In the VGM, these convertors has been generalized and improved.\ngeomGeant4: User Geant4 detector construction class can be passed to Geant4 VMC via user defined run configuration class (see User Geant4 Classes). If Geant4 VMC is built with VGM, geometry can be exported in Root using the built-in command:\n/vgm/generateRoot and reused in Geant3 or Fluka (when available) VMC simulation.\nUseful commands Geant4 VMC implements various commands which allow users to get more information about their application setup:\n/mcDet/printMaterials /mcDet/printMaterialsProperties /mcDet/printMedia /mcDet/printVolumes prints materials, material properties, tracking media, volumes\nIn Geant4 VMC, there is by default set a step limit 10 cm for all materials with density lower than 0.001 g/cm3. This default setting can be overridden via the following commands:\n/mcDet/setLimitDensity 1.e-6 g/cm3 /mcDet/setMaxStepInLowDensityMaterials 1 mm How to apply Geant4 commands in a Root user session is explained at the section on Switching User Interfaces.\nGeometry in XML The VGM provides also the XML exporters which enable to generate XML files with geometry description in the AGDD or GDML formats. If Geant4 VMC is compiled with USE_VGM option, geometry can be exported to XML using the built-in commands:\n/vgm/generateAGDD [volumeName] /vgm/generateGDML [volumeName] If volumeName is not specified, the whole geometry volume tree is exported. The geometry can be then browsed and visualized using GraXML tool.\n“MANY” positions As Geant4 does not support overlapping geometries, the positions with MANY option are not allowed with Geant4 navigation.\nIn case of geomVMCtoGeant4 option, user has a possibility to identify all ONLY volumes that overlap with the MANY ones using TVirtualMC::Gsbool() function for each overlap. This info is then used to perform automatically Boolean operations on the concerned solids. The volume with a “MANY” position can have only this position if Gsbool is used.\nIn case of geomRootToGeant4 option, the MANY option is ignored and if present in geometry, Gean4 geometry will be incorrect.\nThere is no limitation on use of the MANY option with G4Root navigation (options geomVMCtoRoot, geomRoot).",

The Geant4 MT installation requires -ftls-model=global-dynamic model. The VMC application will run in a sequential mode in both cases. Geant4 VMC 3.00.x version is migrated to Geant4 multi-threading and can be built against both Geant4 sequential and Geant4 multi-threading installations. The -ftls-model=global-dynamic model is required for running VMC applications from Root session (in a \"traditional\" way with dynamic loading of libraries). Since 3.00.x version, CMake configuration files are provided to build VMC application main program linked with all libraries, Geant4 built with -ftls-model=initial-exec model (default) can be then used. Only VMC applications which are migrated to multi-threading mode can be built and run against Geant4 multi-threading installation. Non migrated application have to be built against Geant4 sequential installation. The path to the Geant4 installation is defined with the Geant4 configuration script: geant4-config ... Geant4 configuration script To make Geant4 binaries (geant4-config) and libraries available on your PATH and library path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X), you should source the relevant script from your Geant4 installation (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX): $ . bin/geant4.sh ... on bourne shells (eg. bash) or $ source bin/geant4.csh ... on C shells Note that the G4INSTALL environment variable should NOT be set in this case as it would trigger building geant4_vmc against the Geant4 configuration via GNUmake build. VGM (optional) Since the version 2.0, you can choose to run Geant4 with the Geant4 native geometry navigation or the G4Root navigation. To run with the Geant4 native geometry navigation in case your geometry is defined via the Root geometry package, you will have to install the Virtual Geometry Model (VGM) package. See the VGM Web site how to do it. VGM is used in Geant4 VMC for a geometry in memory conversion from Root TGeo objects to the Geant4 native geometry. More details about this can be found at the page on geometry definition and navigation.

The propagation of tracks inside the magnetic field in Geant4 can be performed to a user-defined accuracy. See more details in the Electromagnetic Field section in the Geant4 User Guide for Application Developers. Note that while Geant4 allows magnetic, electric and electromagnetic fields, the VMC is currently limited to magnetic fields only.\nLocal fields Since Geant4 VMC version 3.2, it is possible to define local magnetic fields. The local field is defined in the same way as a global field, via TVirtualMagField interface, but then it has to be associated with a selected volume using TGeoVolume::SetField(TObject*) function. The local magnetic field is applied also to all volume daughters, it is possible to combine a global field with one or more local fields. Note that the local fields are supported only with Geant4 and an equivalent global magnetic field has to be provided for Geant3 simulation.\nThe local fields defined in Root geometry are not taken into account automatically (to avoid unnecessary processing of the volume tree in applications which do not define local magnetic fields) and their usage has to be activated via:\n/mcDet/setIsLocalMagField true Since Geant4 VMC version 3.5, it is possible to propagate the zero magnetic field defined in tracking media in Geant4 geometry. A local zero magnetic field is set to all logical volumes associated with the tracking medium with ‘ifield = 0’ if a global magnetic field is defined.

It is a user responsibility to choose the type of equation of motion and the integration method compatible with the user field. (The defined commands are not limited to magnetic field only in order to make easier an eventual future extension of VMC to electric and electromagnetic fields.)\nThe available commands:\nSelect the integrator (stepper) of particle’s equation of motion; the default stepper is G4ClassicalRK4:\n/mcMagField/stepperType stepperType Select the type of equation of motion of a particle in a field; the default is G4Mag_UsualEqRhs:\n/mcMagField/equationType eqType Set the accuracy parameters delta intersection and delta one step of the G4 Field Manager. The default values in Geant4 are 0.001mm and 0.01mm respectively.\n/mcMagField/setDeltaIntersection value [unit] /mcMagField/setDeltaOneStep value [unit] Set the step minimum and delta chord parameters to G4 Chord Finder. The default values in Geant4 are 0.01mm and 0.25mm respectively.:\n/mcMagField/setStepMinimum value [unit] /mcMagField/setDeltaChord value [unit] Set the MinimumEpsilonStep and the MaximumEpsilonStep parameters of the G4 Field Manager. The default values in Geant4 are 5.0e-5 and 0.001 respectively.\n/mcMagField/setMinimumEpsilonStep value /mcMagField/setMaximumEpsilonStep value Activate utilizing of a “cached magnetic field” (available since version 3.2) . The cached field value (the value from a previous call) is returned in case a new call is performed for a point which distance from a previous one is smaller than the value of the “ConstDistance” parameter.\n/mcMagField/setConstDistance value [unit] To customize local field parameters, a command directory for the local field has to be created first using:\n/mcDet/createMagFieldParameters volumeName The same commands as for a global field are then available under this directory:\n/mcMagField/volumeName/stepperType stepperType /mcMagField/volumeName/equationType eqType ... Since Geant4 VMC version 3.2, users can also provide their own magnetic field equation of motion and/or its integrator. These objects should be instantiated in a detector construction class derived from TG4DetConstruction or post-detector construction class derived from TG4VUserPostDetConstruction if using ROOT navigation. This use case is demonstrated in the E03 example in Ex03PostDetConstruction and Ex03RunConfiguration4 classes. How to include user Geant4 classes in a VMC application is explained at the section on User Geant4 classes.\nControl of the parameters for killing looping particles Since Geant4 10.5, users can change the thresholds for killing ‘looping’ tracks, which criteria can be used to ensure that a track continues to propagate and for how many steps an ‘important’ track that is ‘looping’ can survive (see more details in Transportation in Magnetic Field - Further Details section in Geant4 Guide for Application Developers).\nThe following UI commands were introduced in Geant4 VMC development version, and back-ported to Geant4 VMC 5.0.p5, for this control.\nThe commands for using preset thresholds for killing loopers:\n/mcPhysics/useLowLooperThresholds /mcPhysics/useHighLooperThresholds The commands for modifying the parameters for killing looping particles\n/mcRun/setLooperThresholdWarningEnergy value unit /mcRun/setLooperThresholImportantEnergy value unit /mcRun/setNumberOfLooperThresholdTrials value These commands must be called before the run initialization, so that Geant4 VMC performs the setting at the right time.\nHow to apply Geant4 commands in a Root user session is explained at the section on Switching User Interfaces.",

The local field is defined in the same way as a global field, via TVirtualMagField interface, but then it has to be associated with a selected volume using TGeoVolume::SetField(TObject*) function. The local magnetic field is applied also to all volume daughters, it is possible to combine a global field with one or more local fields. Note that the local fields are supported only with Geant4 and an equivalent global magnetic field has to be provided for Geant3 simulation.",

See below tips for configuration and installation of these packages.\nThe vmc core package was separated from the ROOT source into a new stand-alone vmc package in the GitHub vmc-project organization. The motivation for this step was a gain in flexibility and faster workflow for new developments of multiple engine mode. The vmc package in ROOT is deprecated since ROOT version 6.18 (its compilation is optional) and it is going to be removed in the next ROOT version, 6.26. The VMC stand-alone is supported since Geant4 VMC 5.0.\nGeant4 VMC uses CMake to configure a build system for compiling and installing the headers, libraries and CMake configuration files. To install geant4_vmc:\nFirst get the Geant4 VMC source from the Download page. We will assume that the Geant4 VMC package sits in a subdirectory /mypath/geant4_vmc Create build directory alongside our source directory $ cd /mypath $ mkdir geant4_vmc_build $ ls geant4_vmc geant4_vmc_build To configure the build, change into the build directory and run CMake: $ cd /mypath/geant4_vmc_build $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mypath/geant4_vmc_install /mypath/geant4_vmc If ROOT and Geant4 environment was defined using thisroot.[c]sh and geant4.[c]sh scripts, there is no need to provide path to their installations. Otherwise, they can be provided using -DROOT_DIR and -DGeant4_DIR cmake options.\nSince Geant4 VMC 5.4, the VMC stand-alone library has to be provided using -DVMC_DIR cmake option. If the VMC stand-alone library is not found, the deprecated VMC library in ROOT (availble if ROOT was built with the vmc option enabled) can still be used, a deprecation warning will be issued in this case.\nSince Geant4 VMC 6.0, the deprecated VMC library in ROOT cannot be used and building against ROOT built with the vmc option enabled will fail with CMake error.\nAfter the configuration has run, CMake will have generated Unix Makefiles for building Geant4 VMC. To run the build, simply execute make in the build directory: $ make -jN where N is the number of parallel jobs you require (e.g. if your machine has a dual core processor, you could set N to 2).\nIf you need more output to help resolve issues or simply for information, run make as $ make -jN VERBOSE=1 Once the build has completed, you can install Geant4 VMC to the directory you specified earlier in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX by running $ make install This will build geant4_vmc, g4root and examples packages. For VMC examples see VMC examples installation page.\nBuild Options Required and Optional Packages The instructions above apply to the installation since the version 3.0 built against Geant4 10.00.p03.

The vmc package in ROOT is deprecated since ROOT version 6.18 (its compilation is optional) and it is going to be removed in the next ROOT version, 6.26. The VMC stand-alone is supported since Geant3 3.0.\nGeant3 with VMC uses CMake to configure a build system for compiling and installing the headers, libraries and Cmake configuration files.\nTo install geant3:\nFirst get the Geant3 source from the Download page. We will assume that the Geant3 package sits in a subdirectory /mypath/geant3 Create build directory alongside our source directory $ cd /mypath $ mkdir geant3_build $ ls geant3 geant3_build To configure the build, change into the build directory and run CMake: $ cd /mypath/geant3_build $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mypath/geant3_install /mypath/geant3 If ROOT environment was defined using thisroot.{c}sh script, there is no need to provide the path to its installation. Otherwise, they can be provided using -DROOT_DIR cmake option.\nSince Geant3 3.9, the VMC stand-alone library has to be provided using -DVMC_DIR cmake option. If the VMC stand-alone library is not found, the deprecated VMC library in ROOT (availble if ROOT was built with the vmc option enabled) can still be used, a deprecation warning will be issued in this case.\nSince Geant3 4.0, the deprecated VMC library in ROOT cannot be used and building against ROOT built with the vmc option enabled will fail with CMake error.\nThe Geant3 library is built by default in RelWithDebInfo build mode (Optimized build with debugging symbols). This default can be changed via the standard CMake option CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. The other useful values are Release : Optimized build, no debugging symbols Debug : Debugging symbols, no optimization After the configuration has run, CMake will have generated Unix Makefiles for building Geant3. To run the build, simply execute make in the build directory: $ make -jN where N is the number of parallel jobs you require (e.g. if your machine has a dual core processor, you could set N to 2).\nIf you need more output to help resolve issues or simply for information, run make as $ make -jN VERBOSE=1 Once the build has completed, you can install Geant3 to the directory you specified earlier in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX by running $ make install The instructions above apply to the installation since the version 2.0.

    "content": "Introduction The VMC package allows splitting the event simulation among multiple engines. The criteria of how to split the simulation have to be defined by the user and among others the decision which engine to be used could depend on\ngeometry particle phase space particle type any combination of that … Running multiple engines is fully supported for\nGEANT3_VMC GEANT4_VMC This also allows the user to implement his/her own class deriving from TVirtualMC to be used in a split simulation. The communication between the engines is handled by a singleton object of type TMCManager such that the user does not have to deal with special implementation details. Hence, pausing an engine, re-starting it or transferring tracks between them is done automatically and at the same time the user stack is kept up-to-date. Furthermore, the same user application derived from TVirtualMCApplication together with the same user stack derived from TVirtualMCStack can be used for both a single engine run or a simulation split among multiple ones.\nHow multiple engines are handled To keep the overhead as small as possible, the TMCManager object has to be requested by the user explicitly during construction of the user application by calling TVirtualMCApplication::RequestManager(). That makes the manager available via the protected member TVirtualMCApplication::fMCManager and a pointer can also always be obtained via TMCManager::Instance(). In a single run, on the other hand, there is no such object and the VMC would directly interacts with the user’s particle stack. In that case the scenario of how that VMC is treated and interacts with other objects is the same as it was in previous versions of the VMC package.\nThe most important interfaces of the TMCManager to deal with multiple VMCs are:\nvoid SetUserStack(TVirtualMCStack* userStack)\nThis notifies the manager about the user stack such that it will be kept up-to-date during the simulation. Not setting it makes the TMCManager abort the execution. void ForwardTrack(Int_t toBeDone, Int_t trackId, Int_t parentId, TParticle* userParticle)\nThe user is always the owner of all track objects (aka TParticle) being created. Hence, all engine calls to TVirtualMCStack::PushTrack(...) are first redirected to the user stack where a TParticle has to be created on the heap. After that, this method has to be invoked to forward the pointer of the created TParticle object. If a particle should be pushed to an engine other than the one currently running, the engine’s ID has to be provided as the last argument. void TransferTrack(Int_t targetEngineId)\nFor instance during TVirtualMCApplication::Stepping() the user might decide that the current track should be transferred to another engine, e.g., if a certain volume is entered. By specifying the ID or the pointer to the target engine the manager will take care of interrupting the track in the current engine, extracting the kinematics and geometry state and it will save these information for the target engine. template \u003ctypename F\u003e void Apply(F f)\nThis assumes f to implement the () operator and taking a TVirtualMC pointer as an argument. f will be then called for all engines. template \u003ctypename F\u003e void Init(F f)\nThis works as TMCManager::Apply during the initialization of the engines. It can also be called without an argument such that no additional user routine is included. void Run(Int_t nEvents)\nA run involving all registered VMCs is steered for the specific number of events. void ConnectEnginePointers(TVirtualMC *\u0026mc)\nThis gives the possibility for a user to pass a pointer variable which will always be set to point to the currently running engine. Note, however, that there is a protected member TVirtualMCApplication::fMC which always points to the currently running engine and it can therefore be used within the application’s code. TVirtualMC *GetCurrentEngine()\nThis provides the user with a pointer to the currently running engine. An example of how the TMCManager is utilized in a multi-run can be found in E03c example of the geant4_vmc repository. The diff of e.g E03/E03a and E03/E03c nicely highlights the small amount of extensions necessary to use the same application and stack for both a single and a multi-run.\nImplementation and workflow example The general workflow of a multi-run is explained using some of the classes/implementations of the E03c example mentioned above.\nImplementation\nImplement your application and stack as you have done before. Request the TMCManager in your constructor by calling TVirtualMCApplication::RequestMCManager() Ex03MCApplication::Ex03MCApplication(const char* name, const char* title, Bool_t isMulti, Bool_t splitSimulation) { // some construction // user stack fStack = new Ex03MCStack(1000); if(isMulti) { RequestManager(); fMCManager-\u003eSetUserStack(fStack); } // further construction } At an appropriate stage (i.e. in UserStack::PushTrack(...)) you would call TMCManager::ForwardTrack(...) to forward the pointer to your newly constructed TParticle object. void Ex03MCStack::PushTrack(Int_t toBeDone, Int_t parent, ..., Int_t\u0026 ntr, ...) { // TParticle construction yielding pointer \"particle\" // User defines the track ID ntr = GetNtrack() - 1; // Forward to the TMCManager in case of multi-run if(auto mgr = TMCManager::Instance()) { mgr-\u003eForwardTrack(toBeDone, ntr, parent, particle); } // further implementations } Whenever needed, check the presence of TMCManager to decide whether the code should work for single or multi-run, e.g. in the constructor of Ex03DetectorConstruction where its member fMC is setup to point to the currently running VMC in the multi-run scenario. Ex03DetecorConstruction::Ex03DetectorConstruction(...) { // some construction if(auto mgr = TMCManager::Instance()) { mgr-\u003eConnectEnginePointer(fMC); // ... } // maybe some more construction } Transfer a track involving TMCManager::TransferTrack(...). If the target VMC ID coincides with the one currently running, nothing will happen and the simulation would just continue. Ex03MCApplication::Stepping() { // some implementation Int_t targetId = -1; if (fMC-\u003eGetId() == 0 \u0026\u0026 strcmp(fMC-\u003eGetCurrentVolName(), \"ABSO\") == 0) { targetId = 1; } else if (fMC-\u003eGetId() == 1 \u0026\u0026 strcmp(fMC-\u003eGetCurrentVolName(), \"GAPX\") == 0) { targetId = 0; } if (targetId \u003e -1) { if (fVerbose.GetLevel() \u003e 2) { Info(\"Stepping\", \"Transfer track\"); } fMCManager-\u003eTransferTrack(targetId); } // further implementations } To use the same stack in both scenarios (single and multi-run), one can always check whether the manager is present by checking if TMCManager::Instance() returns a valid pointer value. Usage\nInstantiate your application (here the user stack is created during construction of the application, see above) auto isMulti = true; auto splitSimulation = true; auto appl = new Ex03MCapplication(\"multiApplication\", \"multiApplication\", isMulti, splitSimulation); Instantiate the engines you want to use (these are registered automatically to the manager). In the E03c example this is done in TVirtualMCApplication::InitMC but to clarify, it is written here explicitely, auto engine1 = new TGeant3(...); auto engine2 = new TGeant4(...); // Nothing further to be done Call TMCManager::Init(...) (if needed with your custom initialization procedure, see above; that can of course also be wrapped into another method of your application as it is done here), void Ex03MCApplication::InitMC(std::initializer_list\u003cconst char*\u003e setupMacros) { // some implementation fMCManager-\u003eInit([this](TVirtualMC* mc) { mc-\u003eSetRootGeometry(); mc-\u003eSetMagField(fMagField); mc-\u003eInit(); mc-\u003eBuildPhysics(); }); // further implementations } The lambda argument will be called for each registered VMC separately. If necessary, it can be more specific. Instead of passing a lambda function, a function pointer could be given or also an object. The only requirement is that what is passed implements a () operator taking a VMC pointer as an argument. Call TMCManager::Run(...) specifying the desired number of events to be simulated. void Ex03MCApplication::RunMC(Int_t nofEvents) { // some implementation fMCManager-\u003eRun(nofEvents); // further implementations } Important comments\nThe geometry is built once centrally via the TMCManager calling\nTVirtualMCApplication::ConstructGeometry(), TVirtualMCApplication::MisalignGeometry(), TVirtualMCApplication::ConstructOpGeometry() and therefore, it is expected that these methods do not depend on any engine.\nIf multiple engines have been instantiated, never call TVirtualMC::ProcessRun(...) or other steering methods on the individual engine because that would bypass the TMCManager and will lead to inconsistent behavior.",

In this case, user has to notify Geant4 VMC about using the sensitive volumes selection from TGeo by applying Geant4 VMC command:\n/mcDet/setSDSelectionFromTGeo true The volumes in TGeo geometry are set sensitive by setting the option “SV” to TGeoVolume objects: TGeoVolume* myVolume = ...; myVolume-\u003eSetOption(\"SV\"); User can also choose a different string than “SV” for sensitive volumes labeling.

We will assume that the Geant4 VMC package sits in a subdirectory /mypath/geant4_vmc Create build directory alongside our source directory for installation with Geant4: $ cd /mypath $ mkdir examples_build_g4 $ ls geant4_vmc examples_build_g4 and/or for installation with Geant3: $ cd /mypath $ mkdir examples_build_g3 $ ls geant4_vmc examples_build_g3 and/or for the installation without specific MC (only libraries will be installed in this case): $ cd /mypath $ mkdir examples_build $ ls geant4_vmc examples_build To configure the build, change into the build directory and run CMake with either -DVMC_WITH_Geant4 $ cd /mypath/example_build_g4 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mypath/examples_install_g4 \\ -DVMC_WITH_Geant4=ON \\ -DGeant4VMC_DIR=/mypath/geant4_vmc_install/lib[64]/Geant4VMC-3.0.0 \\ /mypath/geant4_vmc/examples or -DVMC_WITH_Geant3, $ cd /mypath/example_build_g3 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mypath/examples_install_g3 \\ -DVMC_WITH_Geant3=ON \\ -DGeant3_DIR=/mypath/geant3_install/lib[64]/Geant3-2.0.0 \\ -DPythia6_LIB_DIR=/my_path_to_pythia6_library \\ /mypath/geant4_vmc/examples or with VMC_WITH_Multi, $ cd /mypath/example_build_multi $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mypath/examples_install_multi \\ -DVMC_WITH_Geant3=ON \\ -DVMC_WITH_Geant4=ON \\ -DVMC_WITH_Multi=ON \\ -DGeant3_DIR=/mypath/geant3_install/lib[64]/Geant3-2.0.0 \\ -DGeant4VMC_DIR=/mypath/geant4_vmc_install/lib[64]/Geant4VMC-3.0.0 \\ -DPythia6_LIB_DIR=/my_path_to_pythia6_library \\ /mypath/geant4_vmc/examples or no specific MC: $ cd /mypath/example_build_g3 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mypath/examples_install \\ -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/mypath/geant4_vmc_install/lib[64]/Geant4VMC-3.0.0/Modules \\ /mypath/geant4_vmc/examples Note that in the last case, you still have to define the path to CMake configuration files used in examples which are provided with both Geant4 VMC and Geant3 CMake installations. Only examples libraries are built and installed in this case.\nIf ROOT and Geant4 environment was defined using thisroot.[c]sh and geant4.[c]sh scripts, there is no need to provide the path to their installations. Otherwise, they can be provided using -DROOT_DIR and -DGeant4_DIR cmake options.\nSince ROOT 6.18, building the VMC library is optional. When using ROOT built with the vmc option enabled, then Geant4 VMC will automatically use the VMC library from ROOT, otherwise the VMC stand-alone library has to be provided using -DVMC_DIR cmake option. After the configuration has run, CMake will have generated Unix Makefiles for building examples. To run the build, simply execute make in the build directory: $ make -jN where N is the number of parallel jobs you require (e.g. if your machine has a dual core processor, you could set N to 2). If you need more output to help resolve issues or simply for information, run make as $ make -jN VERBOSE=1 Once the build has completed, you can install examples to the directory you specified earlier in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX by running $ make install This will install examples libraries in lib[64] and executables in bin directory in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directory.\nBuild Options Running examples For the old instructions see:\nOlder Versions",
    "description": "The following instructions apply to the installation since the version 3.00. Since this 3.00, VMC examples are installed with CMake.\nThe VMC examples libraries require ROOT installation and the VMC core package if using ROOT built without vmc enabled. The VMC examples programs can be built against Geant3 with VMC or Geant4 VMC libraries. Only the examples with the multiple engine mode (at present only E03c) can be built with both Geant3 and Geant4 VMC libraries. The VMC_WITH_Multi CMake option has to be set, too, in this special case.",

User have to choose the physics list from the physics lists provided in Geant4 (see the Geant4 Physics List Guide or include their own physics list. The choice of the physics list is done via the option specified with creating TG4RunConfiguration object. This option is passed asthe second argument in TG4RunConfiguration constructor (see examples for more details).\nThis option can be defined as:\n\"\u003cg4-physics-list\u003e[_\u003cEM-option\u003e][+extra][+optical][+radDecay]\" where\n\u003cg4-physics-list\u003e - is a name of a Geant4 physics list; eg. FTFP_BERT, QGSP, …\nIt is also possible to select “emStandard” which builds only G4EmStandardPhysics() and G4DecayPhysics() _\u003cEM-option\u003e - is the EM physics option (none, _EMV, _EMX, _EMY, _LIV, _PEN) +extra - adds G4ExtraPhysics +optical - adds G4OpticalPhysics +radDecay - adds G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics Examples:\n\"FTFP_BERT_EMV+optical\" \"QGSP_BIC_EMY+radDecay\" The \u003cg4-physics-list\u003e_\u003cEM-option\u003e must represent a valid Geant4 physics list (except for “emStandard”). Since Geant4 9.5 it is possible to combine all EM options with all physics lists.\nSpecial processes In order to activate the support of VMC features like the VMC cuts, VMC process controls, user has to activate the special processes defined in TG4SpecialPhysicsList. The selection of special processes is passed as the third argument in TG4RunConfiguration constructor (see examples for more details):\n\"[stepLimiter][+specialCuts][+specialControls][+stackPopper]\" where\n\"stepLimiter\" - step limiter (default) \"specialCuts\" - VMC cuts \"specialControls\" - VMC controls for activation/inactivation selected processes \"stackPopper\" - stack popper physics Examples:\n\"stepLimit+specialCuts\" \"stepLimit+specialCuts+stackPopper\" Composed physics list According to the user selection, Geant4 VMC creates a TG4ComposedPhysicsList object which is a composition of a selected Geant4 physics list (or a user physics list), the extra physics list ( TG4ExtraPhysicsList - in development version only) and the TG4SpecialPhysicsList object. The inclusion of the extra physics list is optional. The composed physics list processes the Geant4 (or user) physics list in the first order, then adds the extra physics processes (if selected) and finally the special processes, registered in TG4SpecialPhysicsList, are added in the last order.\nSince version 2.13, the user physics selection is added to the TGeant4 object title so that it can be retrievable in a user application.\nInspecting particles and physics processes The instantiated particles and physics processes can be the viewed with the following Geant4 and Geant4 VMC commands.\nTo list all particles and processes:\n/particle/list /process/list /mcPhysics/dumpAllProcess To inspect a selected particle:\n/particle/select particleName /particle/process/dump /particle/property/dump /particle/property/decay/dump To print the mapping of G4 processes to VMC process codes and VMC (G3-like) process controls:\n/mcPhysics/printProcessMCMap /mcPhysics/printProcessControlMap Electromagnetic physics Users can tailor the extra physics processes provided by Geant4 via the commands defined in the /physics_lists/em/ command directory and switch on the muon or gamma nuclear interaction, synchrotron radiation, gamma or positron conversion to muon pair or positron conversion to hadrons processes, which are not which are not included by default:\n/physics_lists/em/SyncRadiation true|false /physics_lists/em/SyncRadiationAll true|false /physics_lists/em/GammaNuclear true|false /physics_lists/em/MuonNuclear true|false /physics_lists/em/GammaToMuons true|false /physics_lists/em/PositronToMuons true|false /physics_lists/em/PositronToHadrons true|false Users can also customize the parameters of the electromagnetic physics processes using the commands in the following directories (use interactive help to get more information):\n/process/eLoss/ /process/msc/ /process/em/ Since Geant4 VMC version 2.10, it is also possible to choose an extra model of energy loss, fluctuations or multiple scattering for selected tracking media and selected particles. This can be done via the following built-in commands:\n/mcPhysics/emModel/setEmModel PAI /mcPhysics/emModel/setRegions trackingMedium1 [trackingMedium2 ...] /mcPhysics/emModel/setParticles all The setRegions and setParticles commands must be followed by the list of tracking media names and particle names respectively, separated with a blank space. The setParticles command can also take as a parameter the keyword \"all\". The model will be then applied to all particles.\nAt present, the following models are supported: PAI and PAIPhoton models which are applied to ionisation process, and SpecialUrbanMsc, a special model tuned for ALICE EMCAL detector, which is applied to e- and e+ multiple scattering processes.\nHadronic physics User can activate a generation of the cross sections plots for a given projectile particle and a target element via the following commands:\n/mcCrossSection/makeHistograms [true|false] /mcCrossSection/setParticle proton /mcCrossSection/setElement Al The default energy or momentum limits and the number of bins can be customised via the commands:\n/mcCrossSection/setMinKinE 1 MeV /mcCrossSection/setMaxKinE 1 TeV /mcCrossSection/setMinMomentum 10 MeV /mcCrossSection/setMaxMomentum 10 TeV /mcCrossSection/setNofBinsE 900 /mcCrossSection/setNofBinsP 800 It is also possible to print the cross section value for a selected energy or a momentum for a selected cross section type (or all types) via the following commands:\n/mcCrossSection/setParticle anti_proton /mcCrossSection/setElement H /mcCrossSection/setMomentum 0.3 GeV /mcCrossSection/printCrossSection All How to apply Geant4 commands in a Root user session is explained at the section on Switching User Interfaces.",

    "content": "The way of applying cuts is different in Geant3 and Geant4. In Geant3, the cuts are defined as a limit in energy, which is applied both as an energy threshold (a secondary particle is not produced if its energy is beyond the threshold) and a tracking cut (a particle is stopped when its energy gets below the cut).\nInn Geant4, there is defined a unique cut in range which is then converted to an energy threshold per particle and material. The advantage is that you keep the same spatial resolution of your energy deposit over the whole detector. It is also possible to define cuts per regions, as in big experimental setups you may want to speed up your simulation by setting a higher cut in the support structures etc. See more details at the Geant4 User Guide for Application Developers, section Production Threshold versus Tracking Cut.\nVMC cuts The VMC provides a possibility for a user to define cuts in Geant3 way. The cuts can be defined globally or per tracking medium via the following TVirtualMC functions: gMC-\u003eSetCut(cutname, cutValue); gMC-\u003eGstpar(medId, cutName, cutValue); The user defined VMC cuts and their interpretation in Geant4 can be viewed with the following commands:\nTo print the cut values for the given cut type (cutName) and control values for the given control type (controlName) for all tracking media:\n/mcDet/printCuts cutName /mcDet/printControls controlName To print global cuts and global process controls:\n/mcPhysics/printGlobalCuts /mcPhysics/printGlobalControls To print the user limits (including the VMC cuts and controls) set for the specified volume:\n/mcPhysics/printVolumeLimits volName Geant4 cuts By default, Geant4 VMC ignores the VMC cuts and applies only the global cut in range defined in the physics list. The default global cut value in Geant4 VMC is 1*mm for all particles which cut is applied for (gamma, e-, e+, proton). User can change this default value for each particle separately or set a new value for all using the commands:\n/mcPhysics/rangeCutForGamma value /mcPhysics/rangeCutForElectron value /mcPhysics/rangeCutForPositron value /mcPhysics/rangeCuts value Applying VMC cuts in Geant4 In order to take the VMC cuts into account, the user has to activate the special cuts process by switching it on in his g4Config.C (see the section on Physics list selection. This special cuts process applies the VMC cuts as tracking cuts using G4UserLimits.\nSince Geant4 VMC version 6.5, based on Geant4 version 11.2, when the special cuts process is activated, the VMC cuts are also directly set as production cuts to G4ProductionCutsTable.\nFirst, Geant4 VMC defines regions per materials. Each region contains all volumes that have the same material. In the next step, these regions are used to create materials cuts couples in G4ProductionCutsTable and then, in the third step, the energy cut vector is constructed (by filling the VMC cuts in the order of already constructed materials cuts couples vector) and then set to G4ProductionCutsTable using its SetEnergyCutVector() function. This is performed in TG4RegionsManager2 (new in Geant4 VMC version 6.5).\nUser can select several levels of verbosity to control the process of regions definition:\n/mcVerbose/regionsManager level level = 0 no output 1 number of regions added via VMC 2 the list of all volumes and their associated regions Since Geant4 VMC version 6.3, users can print or save the regions data in a file. The default filename, regions.dat can be also changes with a command:\n/mcRegions/print [true|false] /mcRegions/save [true|false] /mcRegions/setFileName fileName The consistency of the volume material and associated regions can be also checked with the check command.\n/mcRegions/check [true|false] The old method of applying cuts via ranges can be activated in g4Config.C using TG4RunConfiguration::SetSpecialCutsOld().\nApplying VMC cuts in Geant4 via ranges (Old method) With older versions, the cut energy is first converted in range and then these range production cuts are set to the region. This conversion is performed in TG4RegionsManager using the Geant4 converter classes G4RToEConvForElectron and G4RToEConvForGamma by iterating within a given range interval up to a given precision. User can change the default precision (= the number of iterations), which is set to 5 (was 2 up the version 6.2) with the command:\n/mcRegions/setRangePrecision value The conversion of VMC cuts to the regions follows these rules:\nIf the VMC energy cut defined by user results in a range cut smaller than the default range cut value defined in user physics list, the VMC cut is ignored and the default range cut is used.\nThe range cut is first evaluated within the range 1e-03mm to 1m; when the range cut order is found, it is refined up to given precision (5 orders of magnitude by default) within 10 values of each order and the range value with the closest energy still smaller than the VMC cut is chosen.\nIt may happen that a value cannot be refined up to the given precision, then the best found value is returned.\nThe regions are defined only in case when the VMC cuts result in range cuts different from the range cuts in the default region; then the region includes all logical volumes with a given material.\nAs the range cuts do not match precisely to user defined energy cuts, the specialCuts process applies the energy cuts as tracking cuts when a particle with energy cut below threshold is generated.\nUser can select several levels of verbosity to control the process of regions definition:\n/mcVerbose/regionsManager level level = 0 no output 1 number of regions added via VMC 2 the list of all volumes, the cuts in energy and calculated cuts in range 3 all evaluated energy values By default, the computed range cut for e- is applied also to e+ and proton. This feature can be switched off by the UI commands:\n/mcRegions/applyForPositron false /mcRegions/applyForProton false In addition to the commands presented in previous sections, users can also load the regions data from the a file.\n/mcRegions/load [true|false] The check commands permorms also a check for the match between the cuts computed from ranges and the input VMC cuts. When this check is activated all cut values that differ with more than a given tolerance will be printed in the output. The default value of this tolerance (1%) can be also tuned:\n/mcRegions/check [true|false] /mcRegions/setEnergyTolerance value It is also possible to dump the regions properties for a specified volume or to activate printing properties of all regions:\n/mcRegions/dump volumeName /mcRegions/print true|false How to apply Geant4 commands in a Root user session is explained at the section on Switching User Interfaces.",

    "content": "Geant4 VMC with Multi-threading Geant4 Since version 3.00, Geant4 VMC supports running Geant4 in multi-threading (MT) mode. The VMC application will run automatically in MT mode when Geant4 VMC is built against Geant4 MT. This default behaviour can be changed via the option specified with creating TG4RunConfiguration passed as the fifth argument in TG4RunConfiguration constructor. (Note that the fourth argument, specialStacking option, cannot be omitted in this case.)\nThe VMC application which has not been migrated to MT should be run in a sequential mode, either with Geant4 VMC built against Geant4 sequential libraries or with Geant4 VMC built against Geant4 MT libraries with disabled multi-threading mode in TG4RunConfiguration. Otherwise its run will stop with an exception.\nAs the VMC classes work as a factory for creating Geant4 application objects (user initialization and user action classes, sensitive detector classes etc.), the main VMC objects: TGeant4 and MCApplication need to be created on both master and worker threads. Creating of all objects on worker threads is triggered from the Geant4 VMC classes. Users need just to implement new functions of TVirtualMCApplication which are then used to clone the application and its containing objects on workers: // required for running in MT virtual TVirtualMCApplication* CloneForWorker() const; // optional virtual void InitForWorker() const; virtual void BeginRunOnWorker(); virtual void FinishRunOnWorker(); virtual void Merge(TVirtualMCApplication* localMCApplication); Overriding of TVirtualMCApplication::CloneForWorker() is required, implementation of the other functions is optional.\nThe default number of threads, defined in Geant4, can be changed by setting the environment variable:\nexport G4FORCENUMBEROFTHREADS=4 or\nsetenv G4FORCENUMBEROFTHREADS 4 In applications which do not use G4Root navigation, it can be also changed via Geant4 UI command:\n/run/numberOfThreads 4 Migration of VMC application to Multi-threading Implement the required MCApplication function for MT: virtual TVirtualMCApplication* CloneForWorker() const; and, optionally also the other functions listed in the previous section.\nThe step 1. will also require to implement the constructors for cloning MC application, primary generator, sensitive detectors and eventually other classes instantiated in your application: MyClass(const MyClass\u0026 origin); In general, the objects which state is modified during event processing need to be created on workers while the objects which are used in read-only mode can be be shared. See the examples implementation as a guidance.\nReplace your Root manager with TMCRootManager, provided in the vmc library, which implements in a thread-safe way the functions previously provided in the VMC examples in the Ex02RootManager class.\nCarefully check thread-safety of your application code. Note that ROOT has to be initialized for multi-threading via calling TThread::Initialize(); just at start of your Root macro or your application.\nIn VMC examples, this call is executed either in g4libs.C macro or in the example main program.\nImplementation details \u0026 tips Dynamic loading of libraries requires to build Geant4 libraries with -ftls-model=global-init compilation flag (which is different from the Geant4 default, -ftls-model=initial-exec) and the tests show that it brings a performance penalty.\nThat’s why it is recommended to build the VMC application program linked with all libraries. Since Geant4 VMC 3.00 version, the main functions are provided for all VMC examples together with CMake configuration file for their build.\nBe careful to call TVirtualMCApplication standard constructor when cloning your application: TVirtualMCApplication(origin.GetName(),origin.GetTitle()), Check the existence of TMCRootManager in YourSD::Initialize() as when running in MT mode the TMCRootManager is not instantiated on master but only on workers. if ( TMCRootManager::Instance() ) Register(); The vmc package provides a locking mechanism similar to G4AutoLock, which can be used in the user application for handling the operations which are not thread-safe. (It is not demonstrated in the VMC examples, as there is no such use case where locking would be needed.) // An example of use TMCAutoLock in UserClass.cxx // Define mutex in a file scope namespace { // Mutex to lock application when performing not thread-safe operation TMCMutex unsafeOperationMutex = TMCMUTEX_INITIALIZER; } // In a function where unsafeOperation() is called { ... TMCAutoLock lm(\u0026unsafeOperationMutex); unsafeOperation(); lm.unlock(); ... }",

User can customize this value by the command:\n/mcTracking/maxNofSteps value When a track reaches the maximum number of steps, Geant4 VMC activates the tracking verbose mode and let the track process a few more steps with printing the verbose info.
